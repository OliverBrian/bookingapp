# Project Grex - By Team Coffee :coffee:
## About
![Landing Page](http://url/to/img.png)

Project Grex (working title!) is an booking app intended to enable both students and teachers to plan their scheduling better by providing real-time oversight of free times and rooms plus enabling students to plan and arrange their own bookings/events.

Our current scope is to only support our local school, but there is the possibility to adapt the current structure to fit other schools and expand in the future.

Thank you for your interest!

**Note: This project is no longer being actively developed!**
## Features
### Implemented Features
- **Create bookings** with custom descriptions and invite any users you like with the search function.
- **Track attending students** with map and ETAs generated based on their proximity to the school.
- **Automatically get updated** when the students are within school vicinity, *no more paperwork.*

### Planned Features
- **Intergrated help queue** allowing the teacher to effectively see who asked for help and in what order.
- **One-click exporting** of automatically registered student attendance for easier administration.
- **Invite by group** to save time when creating your events, like inviting a particular class.
